            <p>What was the issue?</p>
            <p>When button A is pressed, the increasing number is not displayed, and the number does not change.</p>
            <p>How did you solve it?</p>
            <p>The initial number should be defined as 0 when the computer is turned on.The link is added after changing the number: showing the number.</p>

            <h2>Task 2</h2>
            <p>What was the issue?</p>
            <p>In this project, we aim to turn pin one on when the place is dark. The flashlight turns on when it's dark but never turns off again when the room brightens. </p>
            <p>How did you solve it?</p>
            <p>To solve this problem, we can add a constraint. In the ELSE case (i.e., when the brightness condition is reached), turn P1 to 0 and the flashlight will turn off.</p>

            <h2>Task 3</h2>
            <p>What was the issue?</p>
            <p>The bug that occurs is that randomly generated numbers are not displayed. We can't tell if we guessed the number 5.</p>
            <p>How did you solve it?</p>
            <p>After randomly generating numbers, we can add a condition: show number secret, so that we can see the numbers we get, and then judge whether it is win or not according to the conditions.</p>
